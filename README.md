catchMeNodeServer
=================

This is the catchme node server

This is a server for the Firefox OS Application available on github (http://messejer.github.com/catchme) (source: https://github.com/messenjer/catchme)

Don't pay attention to the quality of the code, this was done in 1/2 day (server + application)
